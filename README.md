# Simple Page Inspector for SEO and Web Development Purposes

This is a useful bookmarklet I am using on a daily basis for SEO and web development purposes

You can find the encoded code for the bookmarklet inside the dist folder (bookmarklet.js).

Run `npm build` to convert `src/index.js` to a bookmarklet code.

Run `npm watch` to use `nodemon` that will watch any changes made to `index.js` file and automatically convert them to bookmarklet code.
