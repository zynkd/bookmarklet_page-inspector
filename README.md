# Simple Page Inspector for SEO and Web Development Purposes

This is a useful bookmarklet I am using on a daily basis for SEO and web development purposes

You can find the encoded code for the bookmarklet inside the dist folder (bookmarklet.js).

To download locally use `git clone` and install all needed dependencies (`bookmarklet` and `nodemon`) via `npm install`.

You can then run `npm build` to convert `src/index.js` to a bookmarklet code.

For convenience, you can also run `npm watch` to use `nodemon` that will watch any changes made to `index.js` file and automatically convert them to bookmarklet code.
